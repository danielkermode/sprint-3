## Site's Primary Purpose
The site's primary purpose is to show blogs for EDA.

## Target Audience
The target audience is members of my cohort, EDA tutors and maybe friends who I'd like to show.

## Interaction with the site
The nav bar in particular is an important feature that makes it easy to flick between blogs. As the number of blogs grows, drop down menus for each type of blog could also make the site easy and pleasant to navigate through. It should be nice to look at without being overbearing, and easy to read everything. There will be some pictures that are hopefully entertaining to keep readers engaged, and blogs shouldn't be too long.

## Build process
Again the nav bar is important and this may be designed to separate types of blogs (eg. technical and cultural). All blog posts should follow a similar layout to keep things consistent and easy to read. A consistent colour scheme will help make the site pleasing but not overbearing (I have chosen a 'darkish' theme with grey wells for blogs and a checkered black background).
